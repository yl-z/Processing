Through this copy, I learned to:

* use the VS Code live extension to test simple websites
* compare @media, flex-box, and float systems for placing divs and somewhat understand when each should be used; also learned to appreciate justify/align phrases and % units
* make svgs within the html
* style with pseudo classes
